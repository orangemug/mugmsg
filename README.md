# MugMsg
A simple example of messenger written in node.js. This is just a prototype and not no way near a complete chat client (although hopefully one day it will be...).

## Todo

 * Split up so you could in theroy have multiple chat instances on one page
 * Make it as unobtrusive as possible
 * Add openid support
   - Store user details in couchdb
 * Build a decent log library as a part of this app.
